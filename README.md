# URL Shortener Project
This is a simple URL Shortener project built using Django, HTML, and CSS. The main functionality of this project is to take a long URL as input, generate a short URL containing a unique identifier, and store the mapping between the short URL and the original long URL in a database. The project uses the Django framework to handle the backend logic and the HTML/CSS for the frontend interface.
